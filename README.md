# Sefirot

A (currently WIP) socket programming library for the Koka language.
This library aims to provide simple composable utilities for building TCP 
and UDP servers and clients.

This is not a web framework or HTTP server, you will, at the very least, a basic 
understanding of low-level socket programming to use this library.
